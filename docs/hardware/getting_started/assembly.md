### PCB Fabrication

This section describes the process used to manufacture the custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) developed for the MICKY platform. The boards were produced using a low-cost and accessible method, allowing easy replication without specialized equipment.

### Required Materials

- Copper-clad board  
- Photographic paper  
- Ferric chloride solution  
- Any heat-generating surface  
- Permanent marker  

### Fabrication Process

1. **Print the PCB layout**  
   Print the PCB design at a 1:1 scale on photographic paper.

2. **Transfer the layout**  
   Place the printed layout face-down on the copper board.  
   Apply heat and pressure using an iron to transfer the ink onto the copper surface.

3. **Remove the paper**  
   Carefully remove the photographic paper using a gentle stream of water.  

4. **Fix imperfections**  
   Use a permanent marker to correct any broken traces.

5. **Etching process**  
   Submerge the board in ferric chloride solution to remove the exposed copper.

6. **Cleaning and finishing**  
   Clean and sand the board to remove the ink.  
   The PCB is now ready for soldering.

## Notes

```{important}
Ferric chloride is corrosive. Always use protective equipment and work in a ventilated environment.
